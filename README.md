# wordlist_gen
A wordlist generator written in Python
This is a very simple wordlist generator written in python

basic_wgen.py -> just need characterset min and max length to write all words in given file name

small_wgen.py -> first generate and write all characters in memory and then after in disk

big_wgen.py -> generate each character and save it on disk, does not store in memory

i hope you will like my wordlist generators
